# matt-deseq2 &mdash; a not so shiny deseq2 app

I wanted to try see difficult it is to make a shiny app.
So here is a DESeq2 analysis running in R with a shiny frontend.

### Access the app online
You can access the online version at _INSERT LINK TO APP_.

### Contribute
- If this is somewhat useful to you drop me a message!
- If you find scientific mistakes anywhere in the analysis pipeline file a bug and let me know!
- (I have no clue how to do DESeq2, so I'm very happy if you want to help :blush: )
